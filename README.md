# Memorama-Game-in-JS (November 2013)
This is a Memorama game developed in JS without libraries like jQuery or Bootstrap.

The SQL script for MySQL for the records functionality is in the "Base de Datos Records" folder. The Records are obtained from de DB with AJAX functionality but the game works fine even if you dont import the DB.

This Game was developed just for fun to explore the pure JS functionality.
